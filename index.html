          My name is Peilun Huang. I'm from Taiwan. I moved to Vancouver almost
          a year ago. I <em>did not</em> really have any computer or data
          related background. I studied social work and industrial design
          before. I kept changing my major. Hopefully, I don't need to change
          again for a period of time.

          It is hard for me to find out my career goal and enthusiasm. It takes
          me a lot of time and energy but meanwhile, keep learning different
          things and contacting people from different backgrounds helping me
          explore diverse perspectives is not a bad thing I believe.
