          My name is Peilun Huang. I'm from Taiwan. I moved to Vancouver almost
          a year ago. I <em>did not</em> really have any computer or data
          related background. I studied social work and industrial design
          before. I kept changing my major. Hopefully, I don't need to change
          again for a period of time. It is hard for me to find out my career
          goal and enthusiasm. It takes me a lot of time and energy but
          meanwhile, keep learning different things and contacting people from
          different backgrounds helping me explore diverse perspectives is not a
          bad thing I believe.
