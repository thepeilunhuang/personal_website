          My name is Peilun Huang. I'm from Taiwan. I moved to Vancouver almost a
          year ago. I <em>did not</em> really have any computer or data related
          background. I studied social work and industrial design before. I kept
          changing my major. Hopefully, I don't need to change again for a period of
          time. It is hard for me to find out my career goal and enthusiasm. It
          takes me a lot of time and energy but meanwhile, keep learning different
          things and contacting people from different backgrounds helping me explore
          diverse perspectives is not a bad thing I believe.
