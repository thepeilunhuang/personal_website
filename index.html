    <p>
      My name is Peilun Huang. I'm from Taiwan. I moved to Vancouver almost a
      year ago. I <em>did not</em> really have any computer or data related
      background. I studied social work and industrial design before. I kept
      changing my major. Hopefully, I don't need to change again for a period of
      time. It is hard for me to find out my career goal and enthusiasm. It
      takes me a lot of time and energy but meanwhile, keep learning different
      things and contacting people from different backgrounds helping me explore
      diverse perspectives is not a bad thing I believe.
